        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I’m Utkarsh Pawar, a 2nd year B.Tech IT student with a strong interest in software development,
            problem-solving, and modern web
            technologies. I am currently focused on building my skills in full-stack development while actively
            preparing for internships at top
            tech companies.<br><br><br>

            <strong>Background & Strengths:</strong><br>
            Beyond academics, I enjoy working on personal projects that allow me to experiment with new technologies and
            strengthen my problem-solving
            abilities. I have a solid foundation in programming, data structures, and web development, and I’m
            continuously improving my coding skills
            through platforms like LeetCode and open-source contributions.<br><br>

            <strong>Vision & Goals:</strong><br>
            My goal is to build impactful projects that solve real-world problems and contribute to meaningful
            innovations in the tech industry.
            I aspire to grow as a developer, work in collaborative environments, and eventually take on challenging
            roles at leading companies where
            I can make a difference.
